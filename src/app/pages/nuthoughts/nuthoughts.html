      I move through most days quietly. Thinking. Building. Breaking patterns. Letting small ideas
      stay longer than they should.
    </p>

    <p>Some weeks I forget what noise feels like.</p>

    <p>
      I don’t measure growth in applause anymore. I measure it in attention, energy, and how long I
      can stay with one thought without escaping it.
    </p>

    <p>There’s peace in finishing. And power in not knowing what’s next.</p>

    <p>Thank you for passing through this space. May your days be lighter than your ambitions.</p>

    <p>See you soon enough.</p>
