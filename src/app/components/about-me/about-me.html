          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with full-stack experience, specializing in building scalable,
            high-performance web applications and distributed systems. My primary focus spans
            front-end development using Angular and modern UI component libraries, as well as backend
            engineering with Go (Golang) and Spring Boot, where I design and implement robust APIs,
            microservices, and data-driven services.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my professional work, I emphasize clean architecture, performance optimization, and
            reliability across the stack. I have hands-on experience developing RESTful services,
            handling concurrency and asynchronous workflows in Go, and building secure, maintainable
            backend systems using Spring Boot. I also work extensively with test automation and
            quality assurance, leveraging frameworks like Cypress to ensure stability in large-scale
            enterprise applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside industry development, I bring a strong research and problem-solving mindset. I
            have worked on applied machine learning and deep learning projects, including computer
            vision, explainable AI, and multi-modal reasoning tasks such as Visual Commonsense
            Reasoning (VCR). My research interests lie in structured reasoning, graph-based
            transformers, and the integration of AI into real-world software systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy solving complex engineering challenges, whether optimizing frontend performance,
            designing scalable backend services, or translating research concepts into production-
            ready solutions. I value clarity, discipline, and continuous improvement, and I aim to
            build systems that are both technically sound and user-focused.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am driven by long-term growth as an engineer and researcher, with a strong interest in
            building impactful products that combine thoughtful system design with intelligent
            automation.
